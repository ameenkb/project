### ASSIGNMENT 1: BASIC PROTOTYPE

- **STEP 1**: Designing the model

  The 3D design of the model was developed using Rhinoceros 3D.

  The design file in .3dm format is available here.
  
- **STEP 2**: Transfer to Cura

  The .3dm file is converted to .stl fil to be edited in Cura software, for adding support structure, analysing dimensions and build time.

  The design file in .stl format is aailable here.
  
- **STEP 3**: Printing using Ultimaker 2+

  The prototype is 3D printed from the design file using Ultimaker 2+ printer.

### ASSIGNMENT 3: SMARTPHONE STAND

- **STEP 1**: Designing the model

  The 2D design of the model was developed using Rhinoceros 3D.
  
  <img src="https://ameenkb.github.io/Images/SPS.jpg" height="468" width="832">
  
  The design file in .3dm format is available here.
  
- **STEP 2**: Cutting using Laser cutter
  
  The .3dm file is printed usiing the laser cutter on a 6mm thick cardboard under 100% power. After an approximate cut time of 2 minutes, the cut piece of the protoype was obtained.
