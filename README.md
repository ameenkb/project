### ASSIGNMENT 1: BASIC PROTOTYPE

- **STEP 1**: Designing the model

  The 3D design of the model was developed using Rhinoceros 3D.
  The design file in .3dm format is available here.
  
- **STEP 2**: Transfer to Cura

  The .3dm file is converted to .stl fil to be edited in Cura software, for adding support structure, analysing dimensions and build time.
  The design file in .stl format is aailable here.
  
- **STEP 3**: Printing using Ultimaker 2+

  The prototype is 3D printed from the design file using Ultimaker 2+ printer.
  
- **COMPLETED MODEL**

  After a print time of , the the printed model is taken from the printer plte giving time to cool.
 
 ### ASSIGNMENT 2: DOOR LOCK SUPPORT

- **STEP 1**: Designing the model

  The 3D design of the model was developed using Rhinoceros 3D.
  The design file in .3dm format is available here.
  
- **STEP 2**: Transfer to Cura

  The .3dm file is converted to .stl fil to be edited in Cura software, for adding support structure, analysing dimensions and build time.
  The design file in .stl format is aailable here.
  
- **STEP 3**: Printing using Ultimaker 2+

  The prototype is 3D printed from the design file using Ultimaker 2+ printer.
  
- **COMPLETED MODEL**

  After a print time of , the the printed model is taken from the printer plte giving time to cool.
  
### ASSIGNMENT 3: SMARTPHONE STAND

- **STEP 1**: Designing the model

  The 2D design of the model was developed using Rhinoceros 3D.
  The design file in .3dm format is available here.
  
- **STEP 2**: Cutting using Laser cutter
  The .3dm file is printed usiing the laser cutter on a 6mm thick cardboard under 100% power. After an approximate cut time of 2 minutes, the cut piece of the protoype was obtained.
  
- **STEP 3**: Assembly

  The prototype is assebmled manually.
  
- **COMPLETED MODEL**

### ASSIGNMENT 3: BTS LOGO STICKER

- **STEP 1**: Designing the model

  The 2D design of the model was developed using Rhinoceros 3D.
  The design file in .3dm format is available here.
  
- **STEP 2**: Cutting using Laser cutter
  The cutstudio file is printed usiing the vinyl cutter on a 15mm X 15mm vinyl sheet piece. After an approximate cut time of 30 seconds, the cut piece of the protoype was obtained.
  
- **STEP 3**: Pasting

  The prototype is pated on laptop surface manually.
  
- **COMPLETED MODEL**
